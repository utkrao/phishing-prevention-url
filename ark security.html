                    Phishing is an act attempting to acquire information such as
                    user name password and credit card details as a trustworthy
                    entity in an electronic communication. Communications
                    purporting to be from popular social websites, auction sites,
                    online payment process or IT administrators are commonly
                    used to lure the unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may <br>
                    contain links to website that are infected with malware.</p>

                Our software is used for the detection of phishing
                that takes place through e-mails and URLs and prevention of
                acts like identity theft, theft of important data, theft of
                official data and of personal documents and files. <br>
                This software can help to prevent an attack by shielding
                employees from suspicious emails, blocking malicious
                links, stopping weaponized attachments and identifying signs 
                of fraud and impersonation. It is often integrated with
                web browsers and email clients as a toolbar that displays
                the real domain name for the website the viewer is visiting,
                in an attempt to prevent fraudulent websites from masquerading
                as other legitimate websites.</p>

                If the user receives a mail (say in the name of their bank)
                asking to submit details for regular updates or something
                as such through a URL then as the user will click on the
                URL it will direct them to a website. Here our software
                comes into play, it will detect that the website is really an
                authentic one or not. If it is authentic then the software
                will let you proceed and if it is fake then it will send a
                warning message that this website might be fake.</p>
